## Part 4: Set Up SSL Certificates
To avoid insecure connection warnings, you'll need an SSL certificate.

The **general idea** behind SSL certificates is to secure the communication between your browser and the server, ensuring that data is encrypted and trusted. SSL also removes the "Not Secure" browser warning when accessing your services.

### Steps to set up SSL:

1. **For DuckDNS users**, you can use the DNS challenge method provided by Let's Encrypt.
   - Go to the DuckDNS website and get the token associated with your domain.
   - Use this token to issue an SSL certificate through **Let's Encrypt** by leveraging a DNS challenge.
   - Tools like **Certbot** or built-in functionality in NGINX Proxy Manager can help automate this process.

2. **Update NGINX Proxy Manager** with the SSL certificate for secure access to your services over HTTPS:
   - In NGINX Proxy Manager, go to the "SSL" tab of your proxy host entry and select the SSL certificate youâ€™ve issued.
   - Enable force SSL to ensure that all traffic to your domain is encrypted.

3. If you're using a custom domain, the steps will vary slightly depending on your DNS provider. Most modern domain registrars support DNS challenges through Let's Encrypt or allow you to manually install SSL certificates on your VPS.

## Conclusion
You're now all set! With this setup, you can securely access your home-hosted services using your domain, tunneled through WireGuard, without needing a public IP at home.
