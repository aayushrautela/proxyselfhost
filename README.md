### Introduction
Self-hosting your services at home offers several advantages. Your home PC can be more secure, more powerful, and customizable to your needs compared to shared hosting environments.

This guide walks you through setting up a secure tunnel using a VPS (Virtual Private Server) to allow access to your home-hosted services, even without a public IP.
