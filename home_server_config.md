## Part 2: Setting Up the Home Server
Now that your VPS is set up, configure your home server to connect to the VPN.

1. **Install WireGuard on your home server** and connect it to the VPS's WireGuard instance.
2. **Ensure services you want to expose** (e.g., web server, NAS) are running on your home server.
3. **Test the connection** by pinging the home server from the VPS to ensure it's reachable.
